## üìã What You Need First

Before we start, you need to gather some information (like passwords). Don't worry, I'll tell you exactly where to find each one.

### Step 1: Get Your Website Hosting Information

**Where to find this:** Contact your website hosting company (the company where you bought wolthers.com)

**What to ask for:**
- "I need my FTP login details to upload files to my website"
- They will give you 3 things:

1. **FTP Server Address** (looks like: `ftp.wolthers.com` or `wolthers.com`)
2. **FTP Username** (looks like: `wolthers` or `admin@wolthers.com`)  
3. **FTP Password** (a secret password)

**Write these down safely!**

### Step 2: Get Your GitHub Account Ready

**What is GitHub?** It's like a digital filing cabinet for your website files.

**Do you have a GitHub account?**
- ‚úÖ **Yes** ‚Üí Go to Step 3
- ‚ùå **No** ‚Üí Go to [github.com](https://github.com), click "Sign up", create account

## üöÄ Easy Deployment (The Magic Button Way)

### Step 3: Give GitHub Your Website Passwords

Think of this like giving your assistant the keys to your office so they can deliver files for you.

1. **Go to your GitHub website project page**
   - The web address will look like: `github.com/your-name/trips-wolthers`

2. **Click on "Settings"** (at the top of the page)

3. **Click on "Secrets and variables"** (on the left side)

4. **Click on "Actions"**

5. **Click the green "New repository secret" button**

6. **Add these 3 secrets** (one at a time):

   **Secret 1:**
   - Name: `WOLTHERS_FTP_HOST`
   - Value: (the FTP Server Address from Step 1)
   
   **Secret 2:**
   - Name: `WOLTHERS_FTP_USER`  
   - Value: (the FTP Username from Step 1)
   
   **Secret 3:**
   - Name: `WOLTHERS_FTP_PASS`
   - Value: (the FTP Password from Step 1)

### Step 4: Put Your Website Online (The Magic Happens!)

1. **Go back to your GitHub project main page**

2. **Look for a green button that says "Code"**

3. **Find where it says "main" with a small arrow** (usually at the top)

4. **Click on it and select "develop"** (or create it if it doesn't exist)

5. **Make any small change to any file** (like adding a space somewhere)

6. **Click the green "Commit changes" button**

7. **‚ú® Magic!** GitHub will automatically put your website online!

**Wait 5-10 minutes, then visit:**
- üåê Main website: **https://wolthers.com**
- üß≥ Trips section: **https://wolthers.com/trips**

## üÜò If Something Goes Wrong

### "I can't find my FTP information"
**Call your hosting company and say:** *"I need my FTP login credentials to upload files to my website. I need the server, username, and password."*

### "I don't understand GitHub"
**Option 1:** Ask a grandchild or tech-savvy friend to help with Steps 3-4
**Option 2:** Call a local computer help service

### "The website isn't showing up"
1. **Wait 30 minutes** (sometimes it takes time)
2. **Clear your browser cache:**
   - Press `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
3. **Try a different browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### "I made a mistake"
**Don't worry!** You can't break anything permanently. The worst that happens is the website doesn't show up, and we can fix it.
