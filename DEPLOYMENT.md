## 🚀 Quick Deployment to khaki-raccoon-228009.hostingersite.com

### 📁 Files to Upload

Upload all files from the `public/` directory to your web server:

```
public/
├── index.html              # Main entry point
├── assets/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── style.css      # All styling
│   ├── js/
│   │   └── main.js        # Application logic
│   └── img/               # Images (empty for now)
```

### 🌐 Upload Instructions

1. **Connect to your hosting panel** (cPanel, Hostinger Panel, etc.)
2. **Navigate to File Manager** or use FTP client
3. **Go to public_html/** (or your domain's root directory)
4. **Upload the entire contents** of the `public/` folder:
   - Upload `index.html` to the root
   - Create `assets/` folder
   - Upload `css/style.css` to `assets/css/`
   - Upload `js/main.js` to `assets/js/`
   - Create empty `assets/img/` folder

### 🔧 Server Requirements

- **Web Server**: Apache, Nginx, or any static hosting
- **PHP**: Not required for this version (uses client-side only)
- **Database**: Not required (uses mock data)
- **SSL**: Recommended but not required for development

### ✅ Testing After Deployment

1. **Open**: `https://khaki-raccoon-228009.hostingersite.com`

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

**If page doesn't load**:

- Check that `assets/css/style.css` path is correct
- Verify the CSS file uploaded completely

- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `assets/js/main.js` path is correct
- Ensure file uploaded completely
