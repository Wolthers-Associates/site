# Cursor Rules - Temporary Development Version

## Current Setup
- Production Domain: trips.wolthers.com
- Status: LIVE IN PRODUCTION
- Authentication: Real Microsoft Office 365 + Mock data hybrid

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: Pure HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript ONLY
- Backend: PHP 7.4+ (minimal for now)
- Mock Data: Hardcoded in JavaScript
- NO frameworks, NO build process

## Production Approach
- Real Microsoft Office 365 authentication (LIVE)
- Mix of real user data + sample trip data
- Full UI/UX operational
- Gradual migration from mock to real data

## Mock Data Requirements
- Sample employee login (bypass Office 365 for now)
- Sample partner access (fake email/code validation)
- Sample trip data with realistic content
- Sample partner email lists

## Easy Migration Strategy
- Keep auth functions separate and swappable
- Use configuration flags to switch modes
- Prepare real database schema alongside mock data
- Structure code for easy credential swap

## Development Guidelines
- Always use TypeScript strict mode concepts in vanilla JS
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
