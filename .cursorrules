# Cursor Rules - Temporary Development Version

## Current Setup
- Temp Domain: khaki-raccoon-228009.hostingersite.com
- Purpose: Development and testing with mock data
- Migration Plan: Easy switch to real authentication later

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: Pure HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript ONLY
- Backend: PHP 7.4+ (minimal for now)
- Mock Data: Hardcoded in JavaScript
- NO frameworks, NO build process

## Development Phase Approach
- Use mock authentication (simple login bypass)
- Hardcode sample trip data
- Build full UI/UX
- Prepare structure for easy real auth integration

## Mock Data Requirements
- Sample employee login (bypass Office 365 for now)
- Sample partner access (fake email/code validation)
- Sample trip data with realistic content
- Sample partner email lists

## Easy Migration Strategy
- Keep auth functions separate and swappable
- Use configuration flags to switch modes
- Prepare real database schema alongside mock data
- Structure code for easy credential swap

## Development Guidelines
- Always use TypeScript strict mode concepts in vanilla JS
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
