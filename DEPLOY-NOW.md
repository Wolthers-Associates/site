## 🔐 STEP 2: Upload Secret Files Directly to FTP

**These files contain passwords and should NEVER go to GitHub!**

### Files to Upload via FTP:

1. **Upload `secrets/hostinger-config.php`** to your FTP:
   - Location: `public_html/trips/config/secure-config.php`
   - **Edit the file first** with your real passwords!

### How to Upload via FTP:

**Option 1: Use FileZilla (Recommended)**
1. Download FileZilla (free FTP client)
2. Connect with your FTP credentials
3. Upload the secret file to the correct location

**Option 2: Use Hostinger File Manager**
1. Log into your Hostinger control panel
2. Open File Manager
3. Navigate to `public_html/trips/config/`
4. Upload the secure-config.php file

2. Click "New repository secret" and add:

   **Secret 1:**
   - Name: `WOLTHERS_FTP_HOST`

## 🚀 STEP 4: Deploy!
