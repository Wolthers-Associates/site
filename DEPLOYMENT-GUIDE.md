# 🚀 Microsoft Authentication Fix - Deployment Guide

## 🎯 **What We're Fixing**
The Microsoft sign-in is not working because the production server is loading broken JavaScript files. We've fixed the HTML files to load scripts correctly.

## 📁 **Files That Need to be Uploaded**

### **Updated Files (with fixes):**
- `trips/index.html` ✅ Fixed script loading
- `trips/accounts.html` ✅ Fixed script loading  
- `trips/admin-vehicles.html` ✅ Fixed script loading
- `debug-auth.html` ✅ New debugging tool

---

## 🔧 **Deployment Methods**

### **Method 1: Hostinger File Manager (Recommended)**

1. **Login to Hostinger**
   - Go to [hostinger.com](https://hostinger.com)
   - Login to your account
   - Navigate to your hosting dashboard

2. **Open File Manager**
   - Find "File Manager" in your hosting control panel
   - Navigate to: `/domains/trips.wolthers.com/public_html/`

3. **Backup Current Files (Important!)**
   - Right-click on `index.html` → Download (save as backup)
   - Right-click on `accounts.html` → Download (save as backup)
   - Right-click on `admin-vehicles.html` → Download (save as backup)

4. **Upload New Files**
   - Upload the fixed `trips/index.html` (overwrite existing)
   - Upload the fixed `trips/accounts.html` (overwrite existing)
   - Upload the fixed `trips/admin-vehicles.html` (overwrite existing)
   - Upload `debug-auth.html` to the root directory

### **Method 2: FTP/SFTP Client**

**Using FileZilla or similar FTP client:**

```
Host: trips.wolthers.com (or your server IP)
Username: u975408171
Password: [Your hosting password]
Port: 21 (FTP) or 22 (SFTP)
```

**Upload these files to `/public_html/`:**
- `trips/index.html` → `/public_html/index.html`
- `trips/accounts.html` → `/public_html/accounts.html`
- `trips/admin-vehicles.html` → `/public_html/admin-vehicles.html`
- `debug-auth.html` → `/public_html/debug-auth.html`

### **Method 3: Manual Copy-Paste (If file editor available)**

If your hosting has a built-in file editor:

1. **Open each file in the hosting file editor**
2. **Copy the content from local files and paste**
3. **Save each file**

## 🔍 **What Changed in the Files**

### **Before (Broken):**
```html
<script type="module" src="js/pages/index.bootstrap.js"></script>
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```html
<script src="js/microsoft-auth.js"></script>
<script src="js/main.js"></script>
```

**Why this fixes it:**
- ❌ `js/pages/index.bootstrap.js` → File doesn't exist on server (404 error)
- ✅ `js/microsoft-auth.js` → File exists and loads correctly
- ✅ `js/main.js` → File exists and loads correctly

---

## ✅ **Verification Steps**

### **1. Immediate Check**
```bash
curl -s "https://trips.wolthers.com/" | tail -10
```
**Expected result:** Should show the new script tags instead of bootstrap

### **2. Test the Debug Tool**
- Visit: `https://trips.wolthers.com/debug-auth.html`
- Click "Test Script Loading" → Should show all green ✅
- Click "Test Login Button" → Should find the button ✅
- Click "Test Auth Class" → Should initialize successfully ✅

### **3. Test Authentication**
- Visit: `https://trips.wolthers.com/`
- Click the Microsoft sign-in button
- Should open Microsoft login popup
- Complete authentication flow

## 🚨 **If Something Goes Wrong**

### **Rollback Plan:**
1. **Restore from backup** (the files you downloaded)
2. **Check file permissions** (should be 644 for HTML files)
3. **Clear browser cache** and try again

### **Debug Issues:**
1. **Visit debug tool:** `https://trips.wolthers.com/debug-auth.html`
2. **Check browser console** (F12 → Console tab)
3. **Verify file accessibility:**
   - `https://trips.wolthers.com/js/microsoft-auth.js`
   - `https://trips.wolthers.com/js/main.js`
